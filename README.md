# Lay-Z-floorPlanner

This was my first project made at a hackathon, UIOWA 2023-24 Hackathon.
It was my first time using an external js library to make an application, and not all functionalities 
were able to be included due to time constraints, but still has basic functionality with a PIXI canvas and drag and drop tools
